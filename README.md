# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various common data structures and algorithms in C++. It serves as a practice ground and a collection of solutions to well-known problems.

## Problems Solved So Far:

### 1. Binary Search Algorithms

This section includes various algorithms based on the binary search technique, often applied to sorted or partially sorted data.

* **Standard Binary Search:**
    * Iterative Binary Search
    * Recursive Binary Search
* **Bounds:**
    * Lower Bound (finds the first element >= target)
    * Upper Bound (finds the first element > target)
* **Variations and Applications:**
    * Find First and Last Occurrence of an Element in a Sorted Array
    * Search in a Sorted Rotated Array (handles distinct and duplicate values)
    * Find Peak Element in a 1D Array
    * Find Peak Element in a 2D Matrix/Grid
    * Find Single Non-Duplicate Element in a Sorted Array (where every other element appears twice)
    * Calculate Nth Root of an Integer
    * Calculate Square Root of a Number with Specified Precision
    * Find Median in a Row-wise Sorted Matrix

### 2. Tree Algorithms

This section covers algorithms related to binary trees, including traversals, views, and property calculations. The basic tree node structure is defined in `TreesAlgorithms/include/BinaryTreeNode.h`.

* **Tree Traversals:**
    * Depth First Search (DFS) based traversals (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)
    * Iterative Inorder Traversal
    * Iterative Preorder Traversal
    * Iterative Postorder Traversal (using two stacks)
    * Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Level Order Traversal
* **Tree Views:**
    * Left View of a Binary Tree
    * Right View of a Binary Tree
    * Top View of a Binary Tree
    * Bottom View of a Binary Tree
    * Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree
* **Tree Properties & Problems:**
    * Height of a Binary Tree
    * Diameter of a Binary Tree
    * Check if a Binary Tree is Balanced
    * Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree
    * Boundary Traversal of a Binary Tree
