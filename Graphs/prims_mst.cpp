/**
 * Problem: Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
 * Find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph.
 * Greedily picks the minimum weight edge connecting the MST to a new vertex.
 * Time Complexity: O((V + E) * log V) with priority queue
 * Space Complexity: O(V + E)
 *
 * TODO: Implementation pending
